# Extractive-QA-model
Extractive Question Answering is a part of Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval. A context is provided in Extractive Question Answering so that the model can refer to it and make predictions about where the answer is inside the passage. The SQuAD dataset, which is entirely task-based, is an example of a question-and-answer dataset. Data labeling for question-answering tasks (QA) is a costly procedure that requires oracles to read lengthy excerpts of texts and reason to extract an answer for a given question from within the text. QA is a task in natural language processing (NLP), where a majority of recent advancements have come from leveraging the vast corpora of unlabeled and unstructured text available online. This work aims to extend this trend in the efficient use of unlabeled text data to the problem of selecting which subset of samples to label in order to maximize performance. This practice of selective labeling is called active learning (AL).
